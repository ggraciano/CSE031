1 - For '-1', two characters, that is, '-' and '1' are being printed out, whereas for '1', only one character is 
    being printed out, namely, '1'.

2 - To handle the negative numbers in terms of postive numbers, simply reverse them by performing the 2's complement 
    of the number, that is, make use of the 'not' instruction and add one to it. From there, to attain the nummbers 
    into characters, divide the number by ten and store the remainder until the number is zero. From there, then add 
    the numbers attained to character '0'.

3 - The c equivalent code is as follows:

    int mystery(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        else {
            return 2 * mystery(n - 1) + 1;
        }
    }

4 - mystery(7) = 127

5 - mystery(32) = -1
