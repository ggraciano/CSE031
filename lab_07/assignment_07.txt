1 - Buggy swap would seem to work correctlty if there is already something on the stack whose address has already 
    been stored in the stack. As such, the program would seem to be running smoothly, but would otherwise fail.

2 - To guarantee the program from crashing from what is in 'proc', create an invalid address and place it on the 
    the stack. As such, the program would crash since there is an invalid address being accessed.
