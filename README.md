# CSE031 - Computer Organization

This repository contains lab assignments and projects designed to explore how high-level langauge constructs translate to low-level language constructs. Written in C and MIPS, the lab assignments and projects correspond with the following tasks:

0. lab_00 - Getting started with C
1. lab_01 - Types and number representation in C
2. lab_02 - Pointers and segmentation faults in C
3. lab_03 - Memory allocation in C
4. lab_04 - Circular linked list in C
5. lab_05 - Getting started with MIPS
6. lab_06 - Arrays in MIPS
7. lab_07 - Translating C to MIPS
8. lab_08 - Floating point numbers in MIPS
9. lab_09 - Output in MIPS
10. project_01 - Create a restricted version of the grep UNIX utility in C
11. project_02 - Implement insertion sort and binary search in MIPS
